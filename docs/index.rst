Welcome to Pyfx's documentation!
================================

*Pyfx* is a Python native command line JSON View TUI with JSONPath query support.

It is *yet another* JSON command line viewer inspired by `fx <https://github.com/antonmedv/fx>`_
when the author wants to build a both python library and CLI for typical JSON output of various
CLIs.
